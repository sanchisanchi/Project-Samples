# Portfolio

A collection of the more major projects I have worked on.

* [Elevation](/Elevation) - A study in project management. Designed a browser game - akin to chess on a 3D platform - following a typical development life cycle. Mapped out the mechanics of the game to use cases, sequence diagrams, and class diagrams.
* [Hospital database system](/Hospital database system) - Created a mock hospital database system following specific requirements. Wrote relational tables in first normal form, an EER diagram, implemented the database in Oracle, and wrote sample SQL for creating views and other queries.
* [MyCandidates](/MyCandidates) - Coded a mock Applicant Tracking System with a team. The project involved HTML/CSS in a Zurb Foundation5 framework, Javascript, EmberJS, Django, SQL server. It was designed as a mobile-friendly, single-page application. Project documentation include a work flow diagram, normalized relational tables, an EER diagram, use cases, and test cases.
