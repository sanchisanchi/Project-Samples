README
======

* Emberjs: contain the Ember.js as downloaded from the website.
* Foundation: contain the Zurb Foundation version 4.3.1 as downloaded from the website.
	- Remove robots.txt to be unsearchable.


* How to compile the files into one:
	- Develop and write code on each module separately.
	- Make sure to add the new file in __files.txt__.
	- Run __compiler.py__ using Python 2.7.5 or similar versions.
	- Open __index.html__ to test.
	- Don't worry about merging conflicts for index.html since that file is generated dynamically.


* Test routing:
	- Open index.html
	- Try #/employer/inc2759/public or #/employer/com8821/public
